#+TITLE: MCI/Alzheimer's Disease Classification Model based on RBANS Scores

* Background
This repository contains a classification model for /mild cognitive impairment/ and /Alzheimer's disease/ based on performance on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status ([[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9845158/][RBANS]]). The classification model takes in a total of six index scores and sub scores and returns a label (/cognitively unimpaired/, /mild cognitive impairment/, or /Alzheimer's disease/) as well as probabilities for each of these classes.

Information on the data used to train this model, how the model was trained, and how to interpret the outcomes, as well as discussion of the model performance in terms of classification accuracy following cross-validation is discussed in the manuscript: /Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease Using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status/ by Vincent Koppelmans, Tolga Tasdizen, and Kevin Duff (currently under review; upon publication a link to the article will be included here).

* Running the model
To run the model, clone this repository:
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/vnckppl/APPE_RBANS_Classification.git
#+end_src

Move into the folder and install the required libraries:
#+begin_src bash
cd APPE_RBANS_Classification
python3 -m pip install requirements.txt
#+end_src

Then, run the script:
#+begin_src bash
python3 rbans_classification.py
#+end_src

This will ask you to enter the 6 RBANS scores that are being used for classification:
- Immediate Memory INDEX Sore
- List Learning Total Score
- Language INDEX Score
- Semantic Fluency Total
- Delayed Memory INDEX Score
- Story Recall Total Score

* Example output
When entering the following values: =97, 23, 92, 16, 84, 5=, the script output will show:
